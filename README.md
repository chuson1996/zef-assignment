# ZEF Assignment

### Setting up development environment

  - Install latest Node 6.x

  - npm install -g angular-cli

### Required editor plugins for consistency

  - tslint (tslint.json)
  - stylelint (stylelint.json)
  - editorconfig (.editorconfig)

### Best practices for GIT version control

  - Use one short sentence as a commit message (start with upper case letter, no dot at the end)

	> Fixed typo in the readme file

  - If more complex explanation is really needed for the commit then add a body to the commit message

	> Fixed nasty bug in app listing
	>
	> When app had a scandic letters in its name the whole list got broken. This was due to our simple
	> hack that we use to migrate old apps.

### Best practices for coding with Angular 2

  - In short do not just produce code blindly, but also think of the readability of the code by structuring it sensibly, using enough spacing and using short but understandable variable / function names

  Structure your code primarily according to some logic (order of inheritance, order of use, relevance, type, etc.) and secondarily alphabetically. Having some logic behind structuring the code will always make it more readable to others and things can be find more quickly. Use empty lines to separate logical components and to make your code more readable. Naturally there is no golden rule for the structuring your code that would be easy to define / describe and would fit every situation, but as long as you use some logic it is more easy to others to pick up on your code. Below you can find some examples how to do the structuring via grouping logical parts together and separating the logical sections with empty lines.

  - Grouping of imports: Core libraries, angular libraries, angular material libraries, other libraries, application files in current folder, other application files. The imported objects should also be ordered if possible with some logic. If no logic exists or the objects share the same logic then you should order those alphabetically.

  ```
    import { Observable } from "rxjs/Observable";

    import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
    import { Router, ActivatedRoute, NavigationEnd } from '@angular/router';

    import { MdButton } from '@angular2-material/button';
    import { MdSlider } from '@angular2-material/slider';

    import { SwiperViewComponent, SwiperItemComponent } from 'angular2-swiper-wrapper';

    import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

    import { SomeService } from '../shared/services/some.service';
  ```

  - Grouping of object properties: public properties, private properties, input properties, output properties, other decorated properties

  ```
    public name: string = '';

    private group: string = '';
    private label: string = '';

    @Input() id: string = '';
    @Input() gid: string = '';

    @Input()
    get username(): string {
      return this.name;
    }
    set username(name: string) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    @Output() fullname = new EventEmitter<string>();

    @ViewChild('button') button: CoolButtonComponent;
  ```

  - Also to get good quality code you should take full advantage of the Typescript features by defining your variables as public or private, defining the types of the variables and when it makes sense set sensible default value

  - Grouping of object functions: Constructor, interface functions, public api functions, utility / helper functions, event handling functions

  ```
    constructor() {}

    ngOnInit() {}

    ngOnDestroy() {}

    setViewIndex(index: number) {}

    onTabSelected(event: any, tab: string) {}

    onLinkClicked(event: any, link: string) {}
  ```

  - Order of function parameters should come naturally based on the importance of the parameters (most relative first and the obsolete parameters as last)

  - Also structure the actual code lines with empty lines and spaces (after control statements: if, for, while, etc. and before brackets / type definitions)

  ```
    someFunction(variable: string): boolean {
      let retVal: boolean = false;

      if (variable === true) {
         retVal = true;
      } else {
        retVal = false;
      }

      return retVal;
    }
  ```

  - Also always use brackets with control statements unless the code regarding the statement is on a single line (if possible avoid the single line control statements since they rarely make the code more readable)

  - Structure HTML attributes with the following logic: #ids, *directives, normal attributes, inputs, outputs, models

  ```
    <input *ngIf="show" class="container" [value]="value" (change)="onInputChange($event)"></input>
  ```

  - Structure CSS / SCSS style declarations according to idiomatic ordering (https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css#declaration-order): Positioning, display & box model, other

  ```
    .selector {
      position: absolute;
      z-index: 10;
      top: 0;

      display: inline-block;
      overflow: hidden;
      box-sizing: border-box;
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      padding: 16px;
      border: 1px solid #000;
      margin: 16px;

      color: #fff;
      background: #000;
      font-size: 32px;
      font-family: 'Open Sans';
      text-align: center;
    }
  ```

  - Use nested hierarchy instead of plain CSS hierarchy for better readability and easier style adding

  ```
    .container {
      padding: 16px;

      .title {
        font-size: 16px;
      }
    }
  ```

  - To create new components, services, pipes etc. use the angular-cli tool and for the directory structure use + as prefix for routes and place components / services / pipes / models / etc. that are used by multiple components into shared folder
